*Project name: The Lovely Store*

This project is a simple, responsive storefront webpage built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. It showcases a furniture and home décor shop layout featuring a navigation bar, product grid, and footer with a newsletter signup and social media links.

The page uses Bootstrap’s grid system and components to create a mobile-friendly product catalogue, while a small custom CSS file adds a smooth hover-scale effect to product images for improved user interaction. The project is purely front-end and serves as a clean example of a modern, accessible e-commerce UI layout.
